# Devtools Automated Setup


This is just to make my life easier now that I am using my school's computers (bigger monitors)
and I want my environment to get setup automatatically every time I login to a new machine



Just run bash config.sh and it should set things up automatically
Some things are specifically for iTerm, for instance the themes and plist
file. The plist file contains the profile that automatically loads extra
things like font, theme, and maps the option+arrow keys to function 
properly
